# data_cleaning_tools
This repository contains a collection of methods and functions that are useful for cleaning large epidemiological data sets.

The orginal functions were designed to clean owner questionnaire data from a longitudinal cohort of dogs enrolled in an epidemioligical study. 

Variables that have been cleaned so far with some of these tools include the date of birth, sex, colour, height, weight and illness episode dates of dogs. 

These functions and methods may have wider applications to other research.
